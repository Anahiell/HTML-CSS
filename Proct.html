A vehicle (from Latin: vehiculum<sup><a href="#first">[1]</a></sup>) is a machine that transports people or cargo. 
Vehicles include wagons, bicycles motor vehicles (motorcycles, cars, trucks, buses), railed vehicles (trains, trams), watercraft (ships, boats),
amphibious vehicles (screw-propelled vehicle, hovercraft), aircraft (airplanes, helicopters) and spacecraft.<sup><a href="#sec">[2]</a></sup>
Land vehicles are classified broadly by what is used to apply steering and drive forces against the ground: wheeled, tracked, railed or skied. ISO 3833-1977 is the standard,
also internationally used in legislation, for road vehicles types, terms and definitions.<sup><a href="#third">[3]</a></sup>
